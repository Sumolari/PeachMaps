Check out the [demo](https://sumolari.github.io/PeachMaps/)!

# How it works

Peach Maps includes Apple Maps files from Apple's CDN and loads a [bootstrap.json script](https://github.com/Sumolari/PeachMaps/blob/gh-pages/bootstrap.json) locally hosted to prevent 4XX errors.

MapKit offers an API to show popovers and add annotations.

# How it is built

This project uses [less](http://lesscss.org/) and [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) but you don't have to install them as a compiled version of source code is included in this repo.

# What to do next
